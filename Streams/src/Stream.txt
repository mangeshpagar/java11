We have two types of stream in java 8
1.sequential stream (default stream) -
	when to use
	- you care about the order

	-performance is less than parellel
	-it uses single core
	It uses default thread pull and main thread

core == iteration1->iteration2->iteration3->iteraion4;
Example : com.mangesh.sequentialvsparallel;


2.parallel Stream
	when to use
	- order is not important for u
	- performance is better than sequential
	- it used the multiple core of system.(different thread will be created)
    -It uses ForkJoinThreadpool.
core == iteration1
core2 == ->iteration2
core 3 ->iteration3 ->iteraion4;

Example : com.mangesh.sequentialvsparallel;
